# Resolving Bluetooth Firmware Issue on Linux Mint 21.3

This guide will help you resolve issues with your Bluetooth device on Linux Mint 21.3 due to missing firmware.

## Issue

Bluetooth devices are not working properly, and the `dmesg` output indicates missing firmware:
[ 7.886295] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: firmware Patch file not found, tried:
[ 7.886305] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: 'brcm/BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd'
[ 7.886310] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: 'brcm/BCM-0a5c-21d7.hcd'


## Solution

### Step 1: Install the `linux-firmware` Package

First, ensure you have the latest `linux-firmware` package installed, as it often contains the necessary firmware files.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-firmware
```
### Step 2: Manually Download the Firmware
If the linux-firmware package doesn't include the required firmware, you can manually download it from an alternative source.

Download the firmware file:

```bash
wget https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware/raw/master/brcm/BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd -O /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd
```
Verify the file exists:

```bash
ls /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd
```
### Step 3: Restart Your System
Restart your system to ensure the new firmware is loaded.


```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Step 4: Verify Bluetooth Functionality
After the reboot, check if your Bluetooth device is working correctly by searching for devices.

### Step 5: Check the dmesg Output
Verify that there are no errors related to Bluetooth firmware in the dmesg output.

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i blue
```
If you followed these steps, your Bluetooth device should now be working properly.

Additional Commands
Enable Bluetooth service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```
Check Bluetooth service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```
Conclusion
By following this guide, you should be able to resolve issues with missing firmware for your Bluetooth device on Linux Mint 21.3. If you encounter any further issues, ensure the firmware file is correctly placed and check for any additional dependencies or updates required for your system.
