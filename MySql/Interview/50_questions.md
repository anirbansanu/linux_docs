Sure! Here are the questions along with their answers:

### Basic Questions:
1. **What is MySQL?**
   - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing and managing databases.

2. **Explain the difference between SQL and MySQL.**
   - SQL is a standard language for querying and managing databases, while MySQL is a specific implementation of an RDBMS that uses SQL to interact with the database.

3. **What are the different storage engines in MySQL?**
   - The most common storage engines in MySQL are InnoDB (default), MyISAM, MEMORY, and CSV.

4. **How do you create a database in MySQL?**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   ```

5. **How do you create a table in MySQL?**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
     column1 datatype,
     column2 datatype,
     ...
   );
   ```

6. **How do you insert data into a table?**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
   VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
   ```

7. **What is the purpose of the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute in MySQL?**
   - `AUTO_INCREMENT` is used to automatically generate a unique identifier for new rows in a table, typically used for primary keys.

8. **How do you update data in a table?**
   ```sql
   UPDATE table_name
   SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
   WHERE condition;
   ```

9. **How do you delete data from a table?**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM table_name
   WHERE condition;
   ```

10. **How do you retrieve data from a table?**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

### Intermediate Questions:
11. **What are the different types of joins in MySQL?**
    - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN, SELF JOIN.

12. **Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.**
    - `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
    - `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
    - `RIGHT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
    - `FULL JOIN`: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.

13. **How do you use the `GROUP BY` clause in MySQL?**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY column1;
    ```

14. **How do you use the `HAVING` clause in MySQL?**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY column1
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```

15. **What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses?**
    - `WHERE` is used to filter records before any groupings are made, while `HAVING` is used to filter groups after the `GROUP BY` clause has been applied.

16. **How do you use subqueries in MySQL?**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column2 = (SELECT column2 FROM another_table WHERE condition);
    ```

17. **What are indexes in MySQL and why are they used?**
    - Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a table. They improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

18. **How do you create an index on a table?**
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX index_name
    ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
    ```

19. **Explain the difference between a primary key and a unique key.**
    - A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot be NULL. A unique key also ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it can have NULL values.

20. **What is a foreign key?**
    - A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.

### Advanced Questions:
21. **How do you optimize a MySQL query?**
    - Use indexes, avoid using `SELECT *`, use the `LIMIT` clause for large datasets, use proper joins, and ensure proper indexing.

22. **What is the `EXPLAIN` statement in MySQL?**
    - `EXPLAIN` provides information about how MySQL executes a query, which helps in optimizing the query.

23. **How do you handle NULL values in MySQL?**
    - Use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators to check for NULL values. Use `IFNULL()` or `COALESCE()` functions to handle NULL values.

24. **What are the differences between `VARCHAR` and `CHAR` data types?**
    - `VARCHAR` is used for variable-length strings, while `CHAR` is used for fixed-length strings.

25. **How do you use transactions in MySQL?**
    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    -- SQL statements
    COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
    ```

26. **What is the `COMMIT` statement?**
    - `COMMIT` is used to save all changes made in the current transaction.

27. **What is the `ROLLBACK` statement?**
    - `ROLLBACK` is used to undo all changes made in the current transaction.

28. **Explain the `SAVEPOINT` statement.**
    - `SAVEPOINT` sets a point within a transaction that you can roll back to without affecting the entire transaction.

29. **What is a stored procedure and how do you create one?**
    ```sql
    DELIMITER //
    CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameters)
    BEGIN
      -- SQL statements
    END //
    DELIMITER ;
    ```

30. **What is a trigger and how do you create one?**
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
    BEFORE/AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
    ON table_name
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      -- SQL statements
    END;
    ```

### Performance and Optimization:
31. **What is query optimization?**
    - Query optimization is the process of modifying a query to improve its performance.

32. **How do you use indexes to improve query performance?**
    - Indexes help in quickly locating data without scanning the entire table, thus speeding up data retrieval operations.

33. **What is a slow query log?**
    - A slow query log is a log that MySQL maintains to record queries that take a long time to execute.

34. **How do you identify and optimize slow queries?**
    - Use the slow query log to identify slow queries and optimize them using indexing, query rewriting, and examining execution plans.

35. **What are the best practices for database indexing?**
    - Use indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses. Avoid over-indexing.

36. **How do you optimize database schema design?**
    - Normalize tables, use appropriate data types, avoid redundant data, and ensure proper indexing.

37. **What is the role of the query cache in MySQL?**
    - The query cache stores the results of SELECT queries and returns the cached result when an identical query is executed, improving performance.

38. **How do you monitor MySQL performance?**
    - Use tools like MySQL Workbench, `SHOW STATUS` commands, `EXPLAIN` statement, and performance schema.
